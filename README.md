# BlemflarkBot
[/u/BlemflarkBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlemflarkBot/) is a [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) Bot whose sole purpose is to listen on [/r/rickandmorty](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/) subreddit and provide currency conversions from Blemflarks to USD.

According to the season 3 premier of Rick and Morty, [1 Blemflark is worth $0](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/62ygal/the_value_of_the_blemflark/).

## Invoking BlemflarkBot

TODO

If a comment has both a `<number> blemflark(s)` and one of the following: `how`, `what`, `?`, `!`, then the bot will generate a reply message that looks like something like this:

If you make a comment that satisfies those two requirements, and the bot is running, it will probably see and reply with the conversion within a couple minutes (10 minutes at worst).

## Feedback/Comments

Several options from low priority to high:
* Send a PM to BlemflarkBot with comments.
